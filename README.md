# SmartTTerarrium
This is a starter project for my idea for a smart terarrium.
I have hopes to create a smart terarrium that will give valuable insights into your critter whether you are home or away.
This will eventually include soil moisture, humidity, temperature, and a live cam. All availble from your phone.
There will also be a automated misting system that will be programable from your phone. You can set it to mist based on humidity level, soil moisture level, or both!
v1 will not have any temperate control available, but there will be temperature available to view from your phone.
